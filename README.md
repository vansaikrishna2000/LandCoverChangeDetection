# Change-Detection-in-Satellite-Images
Implemented Various Supervised and Unsupervised Methods of Change Detection in Satelllite Images

Datset: LevirCD 
It is a new large-scale remote sensing binary change detection dataset.
The link fot the dataset is given below : https://justchenhao.github.io/LEVIR/

It consists of 637 very high-resolution (VHR, 0.5m/pixel) Google Earth (GE) image patch pairs with a size of 1024 Ã— 1024 pixels. These bitemporal images with time span of 5 to 14 years have significant land-use changes, especially the construction growth.
